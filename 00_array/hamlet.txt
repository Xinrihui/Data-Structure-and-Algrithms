Abstract In this chapter, we give a brief introduction to learning to rank for information retrieval. Specifically, we first introduce the ranking problem by taking document retrieval as an example. Second, conventional ranking models proposed in
the literature of information retrieval are reviewed, and widely used evaluation measures for ranking are mentioned. Third, the motivation of using machine learning
technology to solve the problem of ranking is given, and existing learning-to-rank
algorithms are categorized and briefly depicted.

With the fast development of the Web, every one of us is experiencing a flood of
information. A study1 conducted in 2005 estimated the World Wide Web to contain
11.5 billion pages by January 2005. In the same year, Yahoo!2 announced that its
search engine index contained more than 19.2 billion documents. It was estimated
by http://www.worldwidewebsize.com/ that there were about 25 billion pages indexed by major search engines as of October 2008. Recently, the Google blog3
reported that about one trillion web pages have been seen during their crawling and
indexing. According to the above information, we can see that the number of webpages is growing very fast. Actually, the same story also happens to the number of
websites. According to a report,4 the evolution of websites from 2000 to 2007 is
shown in Fig. 1.1.
The extremely large size of the Web makes it generally impossible for common
users to locate their desired information by browsing the Web. As a consequence,
efficient and effective information retrieval has become more important than ever,
and the search engine (or information retrieval system) has become an essential tool
for many people.
